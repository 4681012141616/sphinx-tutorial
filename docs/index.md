## Workshop overview

This workshop will walk you through the steps of using the `sphinx` tool for documentation
generation for a Python API, hosting them on Github pages and automatically creating new versions
on code updates.

Accompanying the instructions there is [this example repo](TODO: fill in link) where you can find
some sample code to serve as a base for the rest of the workshop.

Moreover, all the steps of the tutorial have been applied in corresponding commits and branches, so
if anything doesn't quite work for you, you can refer to a previous/next step branch by using
`git checkout` (or browse the branch in the `github` UI) and continue from there.
