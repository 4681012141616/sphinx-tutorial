# `reStructuredText` basics

---

From the [docs](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html):
`reStructuredText` is the default plaintext markup language used by Sphinx.

## The `index.rst` file

There are many tutorials out there explaining the syntax of `.rst` files that you can try on your
free time, so let's focus now on what exists in our `index.rst` file.

### Heading

```rst
Welcome to office's documentation!
==================================
```

This is a heading containing the project name, as generated by sphinx. In order to specify a new
section, create a heading by underlining the text with any punctuation character as long as the
text. Using the same character will create headings of the same level.

### Table of contents tree

```rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:
```

- The `toctree` (table of contents tree) adds structure to your docs.
- The `maxdepth` parameter specifies how many levels of headers you would like `sphinx` to create
  in its output.
- The `caption` parameter gives option to provide a toctree caption, i.e. the _title_ of the
  toctree; in this case "Contents".

## Creating a section

Now let's add some more content by modifying the file `index.rst`. We are going to add a new section that has
some more information and a picture of the workspace in the office.

Create a new section **above** the "Indices and tables" one:

```rst
Workspace
---------
```

### Image

And now let's add a picture (we used one we found online on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com)). Save
your image in the `docs/_static` directory and type under your header:

```rst
.. image:: _static/workspace.jpg
```

Now re-run `make html` to see your image rendered on the site.
