# `reStructuredText` basics

---

From the [docs](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html): `reStructuredText` is the default plaintext markup language used by Sphinx.

There are many tutorials out there explaining the syntax of `.rst` files that you can try on your free time, so let's focus now on what exists in our `index.rst` file.

### Heading

```rst
Welcome to office's documentation!
==================================
```

This is a heading containing the project name, as generated by sphinx.

### Table of contents tree

```rst
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:
```

The `toctree` (table of contents tree) adds structure to your docs.

The `maxdepth` parameter specifies how many levels of headers you would like `sphinx` to create in its output.
