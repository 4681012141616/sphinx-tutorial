# sphinx-tutorial

This repo is hosting the source files for the
[`sphinx-tutorial` website](https://olgarithms.github.io/sphinx-tutorial/).

This workshop will walk you through the steps of using the `Sphinx` tool for documentation
generation for a Python API, hosting them on Github pages and automatically creating new versions
on code updates.

Accompanying the instructions there is
[this example project](https://github.com/aelsayed95/the-office) where you can find some sample
code to serve as a base for the rest of the workshop.
